Erase pointers of their concrete type and store type-erased pointers.

This is roughly equivalent to C's `void*`, but it does not use `libc::c_void`.

There are two main useful reasons to type erase pointers in Rust:

- Removing viral generics from internal implementation details.
  If the internals truly don't care about the stored type,
  treating it opaquely reduces monomorphization cost
  both to the author and the compiler.
- Thin pointers to `?Sized` types. If an unsized type stores its metadata inline,
  then it can implement [`Erasable`](https://cad97.github.io/pointer-utils/erasable/trait.Erasable.html)
  and be used behind type-erased pointers.
  The type erased pointer does not have to carry the metadata,
  and the fat pointer can be recovered from the inline metadata.
  We provide the [`Thin`](https://cad97.github.io/pointer-utils/erasable/struct.Thin.html)
  wrapper type to provide thin pointer types.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

We require a minimum Rust version of 1.41.0.
This is for an adjustment of local trait impl checking.

Minimum version support is only guaranteed with minimal version resolution
(`-Z minimal-versions`/`--minimal-versions`) due to how dependencies are handled.
The minimum version of Rust will only be incremented with minor version bumps,
not patch version bumps, and will be deliberate and clearly noted in change notes.

If you are a highly paid worker at any company that prioritises profit over
people, you can still use this crate. I simply wish you will unionise and push
back against the obsession for growth, control, and power that is rampant in
your workplace. Please take a stand against the horrible working conditions
they inflict on your lesser paid colleagues, and more generally their
disrespect for the very human rights they claim to fight for.
